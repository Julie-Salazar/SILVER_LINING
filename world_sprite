#MINDO
'''the world in which carlian roams for the start of the game used to be a populated land with incredible technology, flaura and fauna. but after the dwellers of the earth started dying off from mental illnesses as they had learned how to cure the body not the mind or the heart. The elementals, guardians of the earth were able to do nothing but watch as their beautiful creation of a home became nothing but arid and hopeless. 

The elemental Gods, through pure frustration and sadness decided to leave their land behind and ascend into the heavens and stars were they found solice. Now walking in a perfect paradise made by the elementals, whose minds and bodies are unaffected by the plagued world below because they lack an ability to comprehend complex emotional turmoil (hence why they gave up so fast in fixing the world because it wasn't the physicality of it or its excistance in the material realm but rather, the colective contiousness of the planet had died). 

As a sort of inbuilt preamptive feature the elementals simple were not able to question their existance, meaning that they didnt not know where they came from or how they were made but also could not give much importance because they didn't have that active part in their consciousness'''
